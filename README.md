# IMedia_Projeto-Andes

Andes 
Project developed in the course of PHP - INTEGRAÇÃO COM BANCO DE DADOS from Imedia Brasil on Udemy's platform. Uses a fictitious company to teach how to make the connection between PHP and MySQL, besides presenting commands like include, require, session variables, encode change, form submission, among others.

Login and product list:
In this part of the project you can access the login page, the product listing, the details of each product and the logout page.
To login, you must enter the data placed in the placeholder.

Insertion of a transport company:
This part of the project presents the page for inserting a new carrier in the company's database.
After the insertion of the new carrier, it is possible to verify that it will be present in the transport company changins page in another session of this same project.

Change of transport company:
This page shows the list of the transport companies with two links in front of each one: 'Alterar' and 'Excluir'. In the first you can alter the data of the haulier and in the second you can exclude it from the company's database.

Contacts:
In this session of this project, you have been taught how to create a form that sends a message directly to an associated email address.
What I learned on this page was very helpful in making the contact page for my own portfolio.

Upload:
This page allows you to upload files to a specific folder within this project's site.
It was possible to learn a methodology that uses data from the time of sending to be aggregated in the name of the file sent, in order to avoid a possible coincidence in the name of files.
